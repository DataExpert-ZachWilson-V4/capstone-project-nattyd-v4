# Taylor Swift's impact on e-commerce 

Taylor Swift is the pop superstar of our generation. In her sixth concert tour, The Eras Tour, we see the artist performing in 13 different countries and in over 38 different locations beginning from March 2023 through to December 2024. By the start of 2024 The Eras Tour had grossed over $1 billion, the highest-grossing tour recorded thus far. 

Taylor Swift's tour locations have huge impact on that country's economy, with journalists coining the term swiftonomics in recognition of the artist's influence. In Australia during The Eras Tour performances in February 2024, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) attributed a retail turnover rise of 0.3 per cent to sold-out Taylor Swift concerts in the country. 

With The Eras Tour continuing until the end of the year there is an interesting opportunity today to quantify the economic impact of Taylor Swift's activities (activities including her new album release, and her remaining concert locations) within the near future. In this project, Taylor Swift's impact will be measured in relation to e-commerce product listings to provide a view of the global e-commerce markets response to The Eras Tour.
